$ next dev --turbo
[@sentry/nextjs] WARNING: You are using the Sentry SDK with `next dev --turbo`. The Sentry SDK doesn't yet fully support Turbopack. The SDK will not be loaded in the browser, and serverside instrumentation will be inaccurate or incomplete. Production builds without `--turbo` will still fully work. If you are just trying out Sentry or attempting to configure the SDK, we recommend temporarily removing the `--turbo` flag while you are developing locally. Follow this issue for progress on Sentry + Turbopack: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/8105. (You can suppress this warning by setting SENTRY_SUPPRESS_TURBOPACK_WARNING=1 as environment variable)
